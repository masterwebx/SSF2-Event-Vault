# SSF2 Event Vault
Stores custom events for Super Smash Flash 2 and the compiler

## Usage

The SSF2 Event Compiler.exe and the folders must be placed alongside ssf2.exe.

To create and compile a custom event:

1. Create a new event file in the `compile/files` directory.
2. Run `SSF2 Event Compiler.exe`.
3. Click Compile.
4. Test the event in the game.

*Note: In compiler, use legacy option to restore vanilla SSF2 events.*
